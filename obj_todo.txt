Use existing vert type

 - Add calc tangent

Save/load binary: write group tri vectors to mem. This should load super fast!

Using materials: create material from obj_material, get from resource manager.
Then each group has a material with a potential new shader.


OK, obj files have multiple groups. Each one is a separate { mesh, material } pair.
We want to have multiple instances of the same obj file in the scene.
We only want to load an obj file once, but also want to reload it.
So obj files are a resource.
The groups created when we load an obj file are also a resource.
The materials we load name textures and shaders which are resources.
But materials are not resources, they just point to resources.


So when we add a mesh node to the scene, loaded from obj:

The obj is a resource, loaded on demand. If already loaded, we use it immediately.


We iterate over the obj resource, getting the material name and group name.
Look up group in res manager (already added when we loaded obj file). 
Create a mesh node pointing to the group resource and containing a material object
 which points to texture and shader resources. Or material is a resource?

Connect all new nodes to a local root. This needs scene graph access.
