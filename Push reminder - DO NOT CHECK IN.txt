To push to jason-amju projects on github:

 git push https://jason-amju:Henry1234@github.com/jason-amju/glboiler.git


Switch to constructive labs:

 git fetch https://jason-constructivelabs:'Edcr1ukhBL!f'@github.com/jason-constructivelabs/Monkey.git


That didn't work, but in SourceTree, go to Repo Settings, Advanced, uncheck use global user settings. This trips it into asking for credentials again.
