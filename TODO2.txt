MD3 rotation of separate model - broken for gl2 renderer
 - it's because of glMultMatrixf in DrawLink() - extract this and subclass for GL 1.1 and 2

Threads, message queue

Materials
 - Use shader

Shader needs uniforms list

Resource manager
 - Handle pending sets

Split md3 load etc from render
quat tests
  
gl_4 nodes: focus on md3, plane

gl_4 renderer? Or gl_2_renderer works?

Normal mapping

Cube/sphere mapping

Shut down gracefully - prove no mem or GL leaks
Tests with mock types to show scene graph, res manager etc clean up

OpenVR

DONE - Specialised assert
