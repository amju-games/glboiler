Draw wireframe should be an option.
That needs Tweak bar....


MD3 rotation of separate model - broken for gl2 renderer
 - it's because of glMultMatrixf in DrawLink() - extract this and subclass for GL 1.1 and 2




 Shaders should always be shared ptrs to resources, so we can rebuild all shaders.
 Same for textures, meshes. All resources can be reloaded at any time.
 Add Uniform and Attribute types for setting shader inputs at run time.


 Shadows: make shadows work with trees/alpha nodes. Second shader within shadow depth pass.


Threads, message queue

Materials
 - Use shader

Shader needs uniforms list

Resource manager
 - Handle pending sets

Split md3 load etc from render
quat tests
  
gl_4 nodes: focus on md3, plane

gl_4 renderer? Or gl_2_renderer works?

Normal mapping

Cube/sphere mapping

Shut down gracefully - prove no mem or GL leaks
Tests with mock types to show scene graph, res manager etc clean up

OpenVR

DONE - Specialised assert
